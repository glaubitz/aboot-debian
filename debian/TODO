* Better documentation:
  - Remove upstream README when something more up-to-date is written

* Fix WARNINGS and possibly improve CFLAGS for isomarkboot

* clean up our rules file/better integrate with upstream

* Proper solution for the policy violation (dependency of aboot on the
  priority optional packet aboot-base)

* Proper i18n of man pages, possibly using po4a

* Where appropriate, use gettext to localize messages (e.g. abootconf)

* Do other distributions supporting alpha (e.g. gentoo) have some
  "interesting" patches?

* Integrate netabootwrap in SRM-HOWTO
